# Edu-Lend  
**Empowering Budding Developers through Education and Innovation**  

Edu-Lend is a decentralized platform enabling global Samaritans to support aspiring developers in overcoming entry barriers for participating in hackathons, bootcamps, or educational courses.  

Now deployed on **EDU Chain by Open Campus**, an **L3 Rollup Chain built on the Arbitrum Orbit Stack**, Edu-Lend benefits from the enhanced scalability, security, and efficiency offered by this cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure.

## Key Features  

1. **Authentication with Open Campus ID**  
   - Uses **Open Campus ID**, a non-transferable NFT, for secure and private identity verification.  
   - Ensures proof of humanity and represents academic achievements in a decentralized manner.  

2. **Attestation and Validation**  
   - Users submit attestations for funding, validated by event organizers and institutions.  

3. **DAO Decision-Making**  
   - Decentralized governance evaluates funding proposals based on the applicant‚Äôs Open Campus ID and linked profiles.  

4. **Funding Privacy**  
   - Leverages private funding mechanisms to ensure anonymous contributions.  

5. **SoulBound Tokens (SBTs)**  
   - Fully on-chain NFTs representing progress and completion of courses or events.  

6. **Deployed on EDU Chain**  
   - Built on the **Arbitrum Orbit Stack**, ensuring scalable and cost-effective operations with Ethereum-level security.

## How It Works  

1. **User Authentication**  
   - Participants authenticate using their **Open Campus ID**.  
   - The ID ensures proof of humanity and securely stores personal data, accessible only by the user.  

2. **Attestation**  
   - Submit attestations detailing event information, required funds, and deadlines.  
   - Event organizers mutually attest to the credibility of the request.  

3. **DAO Proposal**  
   - Verified attestations are sent to the DAO for decision-making.  
   - The DAO evaluates proposals using the user‚Äôs Open Campus ID, linked profiles (Twitter, GitHub), and past certifications.  

4. **Funding and SBTs**  
   - Approved requests are funded through private funding mechanisms.  
   - A SoulBound Token (SBT) is minted to the user‚Äôs wallet to track their progress.  

5. **Re-Eligibility**  
   - Users with ‚ÄúDefaulted‚Äù SBTs must pay a penalty to regain eligibility.  
   - Users with ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù SBTs can retain or burn them as desired.
